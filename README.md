# 🍐 PearWatching

PearWatching is a decentralized platform for watching videos together with your
peers. It allows users to take full control of what and with whom they watch.
It’s meant to be a all in one solution, where users don’t need to be spread on
different platforms to enjoy content together. It doesn’t have a concept of
accounts, instead every user is anonymous, and they can specify their identity
while joining a room.

It's meant to be an FOSS, e2e encrypted P2P alternative to
Metastream/Watch2Gether without need for browser extension by leveraging latest
Web API's, such as WebRTC.
